# Hands-on L11: AWS Core Services (S3, Glue, CloudWatch, Athena)

This project demonstrates the use of essential AWS services including S3, IAM, Glue, CloudWatch, and Athena to query and analyze an E-Commerce sales dataset. The workflow covers ingesting raw data, cataloging it using a Glue crawler, and running analytical SQL queries in Athena to uncover key business insights.

| 2 | IAM | Created IAM role with S3 + Glue permissions for crawler execution |
| 3 | AWS Glue Crawler | Crawled S3 raw data and generated schema metadata into the Data Catalog |
| 4 | CloudWatch Monitoring | Verified crawler execution logs and job success |
| 5 | Amazon Athena | Queried the structured table generated by Glue |

## SQL Queries Executed in Athena

<pre> ```SELECT 
    date_parse("Date", '%m-%d-%y') AS order_date,
    SUM(CAST(Amount AS double)) OVER (
        ORDER BY date_parse("Date", '%m-%d-%y')
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS cumulative_sales
FROM "handsonoutputdb"."raw"
WHERE year(date_parse("Date", '%m-%d-%y')) = 2022
ORDER BY order_date
LIMIT 10; ``` </pre>
